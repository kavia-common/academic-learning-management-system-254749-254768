# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Environment & Integration

Create a .env file (see .env.example) with:
- REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
- REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL (http://localhost:3000 for local dev)
- Optional: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000)
- Optional: REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS (JSON string), e.g.:
  {"use_backend": true, "use_direct_supabase": true}

Feature flags:
- use_backend: when true and REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL is set, privileged actions (admin role update, grading, signed uploads) go through the backend with Authorization: Bearer <Supabase access token>.
- use_direct_supabase: when true, keep direct Supabase CRUD for courses (phase 1 path).

Healthcheck banner:
- On load, the app calls GET {REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}{REACT_APP_HEALTHCHECK_PATH or /api/v1/health}.
- If it fails and backend is enabled, a red banner appears at the top indicating backend unavailability.

CORS
- Configure your backend CORS to allow origin REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL and Authorization header.
- All privileged backend calls include Authorization: Bearer <token> and X-Client-Origin: <frontend URL>.


## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
